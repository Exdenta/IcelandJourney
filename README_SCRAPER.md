# üñºÔ∏è Iceland Attraction Image Scraper

A Python script to automatically download high-quality images for all Iceland attractions in your trip planner.

## Features

- **Multiple Sources**: Searches Unsplash, Pexels, and Wikimedia Commons
- **High Quality**: Downloads only high-resolution images (minimum 800x600)
- **Smart Naming**: Cleans attraction names for better search results
- **Organized Storage**: Creates separate folders for each attraction
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful delays between API calls and downloads
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and retry logic
- **Image Validation**: Validates image quality and size before saving

## Quick Start (No API Keys Required)

The scraper works without API keys using Wikimedia Commons, but you'll get better results with free API keys.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Scraper

```bash
python scrape_attraction_images.py
```

This will:
- Create an `attraction_images/` directory
- Download 3 images for each attraction
- Organize images in separate folders by attraction name

## Enhanced Setup (Recommended)

For better image quality and more results, get free API keys:

### 1. Get API Keys (Free)

**Unsplash API** (50 requests/hour):
1. Go to [unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
2. Create account ‚Üí Register new application
3. Copy your "Access Key"

**Pexels API** (200 requests/hour):
1. Go to [pexels.com/api](https://www.pexels.com/api/)
2. Create account ‚Üí Generate API key
3. Copy your API key

### 2. Configure API Keys

Edit `config.py` and replace the placeholder keys:

```python
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY = "your_actual_unsplash_key_here"
PEXELS_API_KEY = "your_actual_pexels_key_here"
```

### 3. Run Enhanced Scraper

```bash
python scrape_attraction_images.py
```

## Configuration Options

Edit `config.py` to customize:

```python
MAX_IMAGES_PER_ATTRACTION = 3      # Number of images per attraction
MIN_IMAGE_SIZE = (800, 600)        # Minimum image dimensions
DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 1                 # Seconds between downloads
API_DELAY = 0.5                   # Seconds between API calls
```
