# Iceland Trip Planner

This repository is dedicated to planning an unforgettable trip to Iceland for two people from August 16th to 24th. It contains detailed information about various Icelandic attractions, categorized and organized into individual markdown files within the `attractions` folder. Each attraction file provides a description, key activities, and image placeholders to help visualize the destinations.

Our goal is to create a comprehensive itinerary based on flight details and explore the natural wonders and cultural highlights of Iceland.
