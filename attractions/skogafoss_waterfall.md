# Skógafoss Waterfall

**Category:** Nature & Landscapes (Waterfalls)

**Description:**
Skógafoss is one of Iceland's largest and most iconic waterfalls, situated on the Skógá River in the South Region. It stands at 60 meters (197 feet) tall and 25 meters (82 feet) wide, creating a powerful and thunderous cascade. The immense spray often produces single or double rainbows on sunny days.

There's a path and staircase leading up to the top of the waterfall, offering stunning panoramic views of the river and the coastline. Skógafoss is also the starting point for the Fimmvörðuháls hiking trail, which leads into the Highlands.

**Things to Do:**
*   Walk right up to the base of the waterfall to feel its power.
*   Climb the 500+ steps to the top for expansive views.
*   Look for rainbows in the mist.
*   Begin a longer hike on the Fimmvörðuháls trail if you're an experienced hiker.
