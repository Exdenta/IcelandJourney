# Dettifoss Waterfall

**Category:** Nature & Landscapes (Waterfalls)

**Description:**
Dettifoss, located in Vatnajökull National Park in northeastern Iceland, is often hailed as the most powerful waterfall in Europe. With a width of 100 meters (330 feet) and a drop of 45 meters (150 feet) into the Jökulsárgljúfur canyon, its sheer force and raw energy are awe-inspiring. The waterfall is fed by the meltwater from the vast Vatnajökull glacier.

Visitors can view Dettifoss from both the east and west banks, each offering a different perspective of its immense power.

**Things to Do:**
*   Experience the raw power of the waterfall from designated viewing platforms.
*   Visit both the east and west sides for different perspectives (the east side offers a closer view, while the west side is more accessible year-round and provides panoramic views).
*   Explore the surrounding rugged landscape of Jökulsárgljúfur canyon.
