**Description:**
Svartifoss, meaning "Black Falls," is a distinctive waterfall located in Skaftafell Nature Reserve (part of Vatnajökull National Park) in South Iceland. It's renowned for the hexagonal basalt columns that frame the waterfall, resembling a giant pipe organ. These columns were formed when lava flows cooled slowly.

The unique geological formation has inspired Icelandic architects, including the design of Hallgrímskirkja church in Reykjavik.
