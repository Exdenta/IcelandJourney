# Snæfellsnes Peninsula

**Category:** Nature & Landscapes (Coastal & Other Natural Features)

**Description:**
The Snæfellsnes Peninsula, often referred to as "Iceland in Miniature," is a narrow, picturesque peninsula extending west from Borgarfjörður. It earned its nickname due to the incredible diversity of landscapes packed into its relatively small area, including volcanic peaks, black and white sand beaches, dramatic cliffs, lava fields, and charming fishing villages.

Dominated by the majestic Snæfellsjökull glacier-capped volcano, the peninsula is rich in folklore and stunning natural beauty, making it a popular and accessible day trip or multi-day excursion from Reykjavik.

**Things to Do:**
*   Visit **Kirkjufell Mountain** and its accompanying waterfall, Kirkjufellsfoss, a highly photographed landmark.
*   Explore the dramatic rock formations and cliffs at **Arnastapi** and **Hellnar**.
*   Walk on the black sands of **Djúpalónssandur Beach**, where you can find old fishing boat wreckage and lifting stones.
*   Look for seals on the beach at **Ytri Tunga** (seasonal).
*   Hike in the **Snæfellsjökull National Park**, which encompasses the glacier and surrounding coastline.
*   Discover charming fishing villages like Stykkishólmur.
