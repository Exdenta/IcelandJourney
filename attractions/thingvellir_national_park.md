# Þingvellir National Park

**Category:** Nature & Landscapes (Golden Circle)

**Description:**
Þingvellir National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site of immense historical and geological significance. It's where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet and are slowly drifting apart, creating visible rifts and fissures across the landscape. This unique geological setting allows for activities like snorkeling or diving in the crystal-clear waters of Silfra, literally swimming between two continents.

Historically, Þingvellir is the birthplace of the Alþing, Iceland's ancient parliament, established around 930 AD, making it one of the oldest democratic parliaments in the world. This site was central to Icelandic culture and law-making for centuries.

**Things to Do:**
*   Walk through the Almannagjá gorge, a rift valley marking the plate boundary.
*   Snorkel or dive in Silfra fissure (requires dry suit certification or a guided tour).
*   Visit Lögberg (the Law Rock), where laws were recited.
*   Explore Þingvallavatn, Iceland's largest natural lake.
*   Enjoy the scenic hiking trails and diverse flora.
