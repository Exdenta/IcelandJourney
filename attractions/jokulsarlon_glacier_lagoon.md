# Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon

**Category:** Nature & Landscapes (Glaciers & Ice Formations)

**Description:**
Jökulsárlón is a stunning glacial lagoon located in southeast Iceland, at the foot of the Vatnajökull glacier. It is filled with large, luminous icebergs that calve from the Breiðamerkurjökull glacier tongue and slowly drift towards the ocean. The lagoon's waters are a mesmerizing mix of deep blue, white, and clear, reflecting the ice and sky.

This is Iceland's deepest lake and a popular spot for wildlife, including seals that can often be seen swimming among the icebergs. The lagoon has also been a filming location for several major Hollywood movies.

**Things to Do:**
*   Take a boat tour (amphibian or Zodiac) on the lagoon to get close to the icebergs.
*   Walk along the shore and photograph the floating icebergs.
*   Visit the nearby Diamond Beach, where smaller ice chunks wash ashore on black sand.
*   Look for seals in the lagoon.
