# Wildlife Viewing in Iceland

**Category:** Activities (Wildlife)

**Description:**
Iceland offers fantastic opportunities for wildlife viewing, from magnificent marine mammals to a diverse array of birdlife. Its untouched nature and pristine waters provide ideal habitats for many species, making it a rewarding destination for nature enthusiasts and photographers.

**Key Wildlife and Where to Find Them:**
*   **Whales:** Iceland is one of the best places in the world for whale watching. Common species include humpback whales, minke whales, killer whales (orca), and various dolphin species. Tours depart from Reykjavik (Old Harbour), Húsavík (North Iceland, often considered the whale-watching capital), and Akureyri.
*   **Puffins:** These charismatic seabirds are a major draw during the summer months (roughly May to August). They nest in large colonies on coastal cliffs. Key viewing spots include Reynisfjara beach (South Coast), Dyrhólaey (South Coast, near Reynisfjara), Látrabjarg cliffs (Westfjords), and the Westman Islands (Vestmannaeyjar).
*   **Other Seabirds:** Beyond puffins, Iceland's cliffs and coastal areas are home to numerous other seabirds, including gannets, kittiwakes, guillemots, and fulmars. Krysuvikurbjarg Cliffs and Látrabjarg are excellent for general seabird viewing.
*   **Arctic Fox:** The only native terrestrial mammal in Iceland. While elusive, they can be spotted in remote areas, particularly in the Westfjords and Skaftafell Nature Reserve.
*   **Reindeer:** Found primarily in the Eastfjords of Iceland. These majestic animals were introduced to Iceland in the 18th century.
*   **Horses:** While not wild, the unique Icelandic horse breed is a highlight. Known for its five gaits (including the special *tölt*), they are a common sight across the countryside and can be experienced on horseback riding tours.
*   **Seals:** Both harbor seals and grey seals are commonly seen along the coastlines and in glacial lagoons. Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon is a good place to spot seals swimming among the icebergs.

**Best Time for Viewing:**
*   **Whales:** Tours run year-round, but summer (June-August) generally offers the highest chances of sightings and more species.
*   **Puffins:** May to August is prime puffin season when they are nesting.

**Things to Do:**
*   Join a dedicated whale watching tour.
*   Visit bird cliffs during nesting season.
*   Go on a guided tour in remote areas for a chance to see Arctic foxes or reindeer.
*   Take a horseback riding tour.
